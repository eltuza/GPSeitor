GPSeitor
========

A Python application that processes a pictures directory and generates a static
web page positioning the images that have GPS Exif data in a Google Map in a
gallery-like fashion.

Status
------
    Currently it's in a script-like stage. 
    Very basic but usable. Several features coming soon.

Usage
-----
    ./main.py -d image_dir

Example
-------
.. image:: http://bit.ly/mvt3ve 
   :alt: Gallery with images located in a map
